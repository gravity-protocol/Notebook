Accpetance criteria: 

The following are what we need for Mzcoin and Shellcoin. 

1. A complete technology platform to build a blockchain based cryptocurrenty ecosystem 
2. for item 1, we need to have workkable backend (blockchain full node), meaning that the node needs to have the following functions: receiving and verifying transactions, creating blocks, talking to other nodes to form distributed ledger and other required blockchain full node components  
3. for item 2, we also need to have clients (wallet) that runs on the following platforms: Windows, Mac OS, browser, Android and IOS. The wallet has to allow a user to create wallet, create address, send out coins, check balances and other required block chain wallet functions. 
4. Both backend and client have to be stable enough to be put in produciton environment 
5. We need the whole technology platform ready within two weeks or ASAP (Note NOT all paltform clients have to be ready)
