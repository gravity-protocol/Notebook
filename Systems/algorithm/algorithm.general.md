serialization

In computer science, in the context of data storage, serialization is the process of translating data structures or object state into a format that can be stored (for example, in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link) and reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.[1] When the resulting series of bits is reread according to the serialization format, it can be used to create a semantically identical clone of the original object. 

This process of serializing an object is also called marshalling an object.[2] The opposite operation, extracting a data structure from a series of bytes, is deserialization (which is also called unmarshalling).
