## POST

In computing, POST is one of many request methods supported by the HTTP protocol used by the World Wide Web. By design, the POST request method requests that a web server accept and store the data enclosed in the body of the request message.[1] It is often used when uploading a file or submitting a completed web form.

In contrast, the HTTP GET request method is designed to retrieve information from the server. As part of a GET request, some data can be passed within the URL's query string, specifying for example search terms, date ranges, or other information that defines the query. As part of a POST request, an arbitrary amount of data of any type can be sent to the server in the body of the request message. A header field in the POST request usually indicates the message body's Internet media type.
