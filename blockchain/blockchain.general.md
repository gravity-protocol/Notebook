- Distributed Hash Table (DHT)




## [Distributed hash table (DHT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table)

A distributed hash table (DHT) is a class of a decentralized distributed system that provides a lookup service similar to a hash table: (key, value) pairs are stored in a DHT, and any participating node can efficiently retrieve the value associated with a given key. Responsibility for maintaining the mapping from keys to values is distributed among the nodes, in such a way that a change in the set of participants causes a minimal amount of disruption. This allows a DHT to scale to extremely large numbers of nodes and to handle continual node arrivals, departures, and failures.

DHTs characteristically emphasize the following properties:

- Autonomy and decentralization: the nodes collectively form the system without any central coordination.

- Fault tolerance: the system should be reliable (in some sense) even with nodes continuously joining, leaving, and failing.

- Scalability: the system should function efficiently even with thousands or millions of nodes.
